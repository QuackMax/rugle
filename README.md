# Rugle
Translates search terms from language A into language B, Googles the resultant terms, and feeds the search results back through a translator for examination in language A again.

Why?

Because some content in language B just doesn't get translated into language A, and searching for it in the wrong language or alphabet won't return results.
 
 # Who is this for?  
 People who aren't fluent in language B. Obviously, if they are, they will have better success Googling search terms directly in language B and skipping the whole translation aspect in the first place.  
   
No translation is perfect, and LibreTranslate sometimes fails spectacularly at translating Search terms. In the future a more accurate translation API may be used, but these often require an API key and as such are more of a hassle.
